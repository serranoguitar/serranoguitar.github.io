	<tr><th>2013- 2017</th><td><p><strong>Graduate Research Assistant,</strong> Dept. of Plant Pathology and
							Microbiology, Iowa State University. My graduate research in 
							Alison Robertson’s Lab was funded by the 
							Iowa Soybean Association. I evaluated the efficacy of soybean seed 
							treatments for control of seed rot and root rot caused by Pythium spp. 
							in small plot and on-farm field trials in an effort to provide Iowa soybean 
							farmers with recommendations regarding seed treatments. I conducted growth 
							chamber studies to improve our understanding of the interaction between 
							cold stress and incidence of Pythium diseases and thereby develop improved 
							management recommendations. Soybean farmers in Iowa often plant their crops 
							when soils are below 10 ºC (50F) and consequently the risk of stand loss due 
							to damping off by Pythium may be high.<p></td>

	<tr><th>2011-2013</th><td><p><strong>Assistant Scientist, </strong> Research Department, Dole, Costa Rica
							I was responsible for research projects regarding disease and pest 
							control in Bananas under the guidance of Senior Scientists Dr. Marco Castro 
							and Dr. Gregorio Leandro. We evaluated the efficacy of fungicides for Black 
							Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) control. We also evaluated insecticides 
							and alternative products for managing banana mealybug (Pseudococcus elisae) 
							and scale (Diaspis boisdusvalii) infestations. Lastly, we assessed various 
							nematicides for banana plant parasitic nematode (Radopholus similis) control 
							and herbicides for weed control.<p></td>
