<p>Guitars Under the Stars is a unique event that combine Astronomy and
Classical Guitar and is hosted each year by the Department of Physics and Astronomy
of Drake University at the <a href="https://www.drake.edu/observatory/">Drake Municipal Observatory</a>.
The event stars with a classical guitar concert and then a talk is given by a Profesor in Astronomy to
show the audience how to gaze stars with the telescopes. This picture was taken in 2016 when I played "The Cathedral"
by Agustin Barrios which is one of my favorites classical guitar composers.
